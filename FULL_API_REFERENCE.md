## 6. Proper Application Flow

### A. Complaint Lifecycle
1.  **Creation**: Citizen creates complaint (`POST /api/citizens/complaints`). Status: `ASSIGNED` (Auto-assigned) or `OPEN`.
2.  **Assignment**:
    *   System tries to auto-assign to a Department Officer in that Ward & Dept.
    *   If no officer, Ward Officer can manually assign (`PUT /api/ward-officer/complaints/{id}/assign`).
3.  **In Progress**: Department Officer picks up task (`PUT /api/department/complaints/{id}/start`). Status: `IN_PROGRESS`.
4.  **Resolution**: Department Officer resolves task (`PUT /api/department/complaints/{id}/resolve`). Status: `RESOLVED`.
5.  **Approval (Quality Check)**:
    *   Ward Officer sees it in Pending Approvals (`GET /api/ward-officer/dashboard/pending-approvals`).
    *   Ward Officer approves (`PUT .../approve`) -> Status: `APPROVED`.
    *   OR Ward Officer rejects (`PUT .../reject`) -> Status: `IN_PROGRESS` (Back to Dept Officer).
6.  **Closure**:
    *   Admin sees approved complaints (`GET /api/admin/dashboard/ready-to-close`).
    *   Admin performs final closure.
    *   OR System auto-closes after X days (if implemented).

### B. User Registration Flow
1.  **Citizen**: Self-registration (`POST /api/auth/register`).
2.  **Ward Officer**: Registered by Admin (`POST /api/admin/register/ward-officer`).
3.  **Department Officer**:
    *   Registered by Admin (`POST /api/admin/register/department-officer`).
    *   OR Registered by Ward Officer for their specific ward (`POST /api/ward-officer/management/register-officer`).

### C. Ward Change Flow
1.  Citizen requests change (`PUT /api/profile/citizen/ward`).
2.  Status becomes `PENDING`.
3.  Target Ward Officer sees request (`GET /api/ward-officer/management/ward-changes`).
4.  Ward Officer approves/rejects (`PUT .../approve` or `.../reject`).
